About me
======
As a female unicorn originally made in China, I was purchased at Sainsbury's in Southampton Portswood by my loved parents (Xiaolong Yu and Lu Wang). I am now almost two years old, happily living in France. I now have some group members accompany me everyday. These members include unicorns, bear, elephant, hippo, penguin.
