Hello guys, welcome! As a female unicorn originally made in China, I was luckily adopted by my loved parents (Xiaolong Yu and Lu Wang) in Southampton, UK. I am already two years old, happily living in France now! I have an increasing number of group members who accompany me everyday as my daddy and mommy love me so much. These members include mini unicorns, bear, elephant, hippo, penguin.
