Hi, welcome! As a female unicorn originally made in China, I was purchased at Sainsbury's in Southampton Portswood by my loved parents (Xiaolong Yu and Lu Wang) in the UK. I am already two years old, happily living in France now! I have an increasing number of group members accompany me everyday as my daddy and mommy love me so much. These members include including mini unicorns, bear, elephant, hippo, penguin.
