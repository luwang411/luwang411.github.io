## Daily life

* Morning: watch my dear mommy sleep^^
* Daytime: sit on the bed with the bear, sometimes get chance to have a sleep
* Before bed: this is my happiest time during the day, when I can stay closely to my mommy and daddy on the bed. It is their sweet time too^^.  
* Nightime: watch my parents sleep, sometimes have a meeting with my team members

#### See: we did not lie to you - the unicorn is having a break on our bed, with its good friend bear who is sleeping all the time
